With the former in mind, it is the aim of this notebook to set forward a general flux model that intends to illustrate how mass and energy flows through an [ecosystem](https://www.boredpanda.com/sealed-bottle-garden-david-latimer/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic).\n",

    "\n",
    "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria (such as cyanobacteria) harnass energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy. During oxygenic photosynthesis light energy is captured and fascilitates the transfer of electrons from water to carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates such as sugar. Therefore carbon dioxide is reduced and water is oxidized. Ultimately oxygen gas is produced alongside the sugar in the reaction as set out below:\n",

    "## Nitrogen fixation\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen plays a big role in a plant growth as it forms part of the cholorphyll and the ammino acids which make the proteins of which the plant consists. Quite ironically, despite 79% of the air consisting of molecular nitrogen $N_{2}$ plants are unable to assimilate it due it being inert. So... for the plants to obtain nitrogen it has to be converted into forms that are susceptible to uptake by the plant such as Ammonium ($NH_{4}^+$) or Nitrate ($NO_3^{-}$) so that they can produce DNA, RNA, and proteins which are require nitrogen. This process is called nitrogen fixation and is performed by heterocysts, which are specialized nitrogen fixing cells in filamentous cyanobacteria [filamentous nitrogen bacteria](). Looking at the image below it is evident that the formation of heterocysts inside photosynthetic cells is known as cooperation, where a symbiotic sharing of metabolic products take place. For instance: the heretocysts share the ammonia produced and the photosynthetic green cells produce and share glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Heterocyst](Heterocyst.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some cyanobacteria have a compartmentilisation strategy due to the fact that nitrogen fixation relies on an enzyme called nitrogenase which is inactivated by oxygen. Therefore, if you have photsynthesis occcuring, you cannot have nitrogen fixation occuring. Logically, the heterocysts have to create an anaerobic enviroment that is seperated from the photosynthetic cells so that fixation can take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen fixation as a [chemical reaction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128146675000088) can be described as follow:\n",

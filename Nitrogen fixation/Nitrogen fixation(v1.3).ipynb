The inefficient usage of the fertilizer means that some is lost to underground water through a process called leaching.

The diazotrophs will be grown in a bio-reactor and the reactive forms of nitrogen that they produce will feed the growth of the plants.

For this we need to understand how the nitrogen cycle as a whole works, as well as the smaller processes included in the cycle. To be able to utilise the microbes in the process for fertilizer production, it is necessary to understand how they grow and how they produce the products we need. This will be done by looking at data from research experiments using pure cultures of diazotrophs like the $Azotobacter$ and modelling the processes mathematically. To test the mathematical models we did our own experiments, producing new data to see whether the models could predict the growth and production for cultures that are not pure.  </div>"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The solution experiment showed that Flask 4 ($10$ g/L of glucose) had the fastest growth curve while Flask 3 ($5$ g/L of glucose) had the slowest. This could be just because of the higher concentration of glucose and the glucose concentration is not high enough to cause glucose inhibition. The solution experiment pH graph shows that all the flask's experience a drop in pH, the lowest being Flask 6. Finally the glucose graph shows one how how the growth of biomass exponentially removes the glucose until the glucose is completely consumed. The $10$ g/L will obviously take longer to consume than the $5$ g/L. The packing experiments absorptivity is generally higher than the solution experiment, this could be caused by the formation of a biofilm which would promote growth. Flask's 1 and 2 (which contain different glucose amounts but the same plastic wheel packing) seem to perform the best while Flask's 5 and 6 (with the green sponge blocks) perform the worst. The highest pH seem to be Flask's 5 and 6, but in general it is interesting to note that the solution pH is more acidic while the packing pH is more alkaline, this could be because of the biofilm formation. </div>"

This meant a starting pH around 7.0, a temperature close to 30 °C, a Burke's solution, and batch set-ups. Literature data sets that focussed mainly on Azotobacter were selected. This was done because this organism fixes nitrogen aerobically. Since, the shaker flask experiments had ample aeration, it was deemed that to fix nitrogen it should likely contain Azotobacter. The collected data was manipulated to be in units of (h) for time, (mmol/L) for the $NH_{4}^{+}$ concentrations, and (cmmol/L) for biomass and glucose concentrations.
